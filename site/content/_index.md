    We help organisations launch their small satellites in space using high
    altitude balloons
whyBalloon:
  heading: Why a Balloon?
  reasons:
    - body: The Balloon lifts the rocket to **32km** altitude
      reasonImage: /img/reason-1.svg
    - body: This is above **99%** of the earth's atmosphere
      reasonImage: /img/reason-2.svg
    - body: Less air density means less **thrust** required for the rocket
      reasonImage: /img/reason-3.svg
    - body: Only a small rocket is required resulting in smaller operating **costs**
      reasonImage: /img/reason-4.svg
    - body: '**Safer** ground operations'
      reasonImage: /img/reason-5.svg
    - body: Huge ground **infrastructure** not required

        TU2Space is a student led project within the School of Science
        Engineering and Design at Teesside. The project was initiated by Shaun
        after he approached the University with the basic concept of developing
        a small space launch system for a femto-satellite called Thumbsat.
    - ourStoryText: >-
        Andrew and Ben are student project managers of the TU2Space project and
        have recently co-founded a start-up business, StratoBooster. Their
        business plans are to commercialise their work from TU2Space with the
        aim of further researching and testing their current work and developing
        the small space launch system for customers, who have already expressed
        interest in using this system.

        Shaun Whitehead, an experienced space engineer, will join their team as
        a consultant to provide his expert technical advice.

  intro: >-
    Andrew Dunn and Ben Massey are Aerospace Engineering students at Teesside
    University. During their 2nd year they became involved in a project now
    called TU2Space. It is here that they met Shaun Whitehead, a Space Engineer!
