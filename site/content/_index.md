    We help organisations launch their small satellites in space using high
    altitude balloons

  heading: Why a Balloon?
  reasons:
    - reasonImage: /img/reason-1.svg
      reasonText: The Balloon lifts the rocket to **32km** altitude
    - reasonImage: /img/reason-2.svg
      reasonText: This is above **99%** of the earth's atmosphere
    - reasonImage: /img/reason-3.svg
      reasonText: Less air density means less **thrust** required for the rocket
    - reasonImage: /img/reason-4.svg
      reasonText: Only a small rocket is required resulting in smaller operating **costs**
    - reasonImage: /img/reason-5.svg
      reasonText: \*\*Safer\*\* ground operations
    - reasonImage: /img/reason-6.svg
      reasonText: Huge ground \*\*infrastructure\*\* not required

  reasons:
    - reasonImage: /img/why-strato-1.svg
      reasonText: Lower operating costs than other space launch providers
    - reasonImage: /img/why-strato-2.svg
      reasonText: 'Flexible launch locations, from a beach to a field'

      reasonText: There isn't currently any small launch systems
    - reasonImage: /img/why-strato-4.svg
      reasonText: >-
        Effects of weather on balloons are minimal, resulting in a robust ground
        launch system
    - reasonImage: /img/why-strato-5.svg
      reasonText: There hasn't been a commercial space launch from UK soil
    - reasonImage: /img/why-strato-6.svg
      reasonText: We aim to be the first to do that
