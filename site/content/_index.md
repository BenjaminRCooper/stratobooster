  heading: Why a Balloon?
  reasons:
    - body: The Balloon lifts the rocket to **32km** altitude
      reasonImage: /img/reason-1.svg
    - body: This is above **99%** of the earth's atmosphere
      reasonImage: /img/reason-2.svg
    - body: Less air density means less **thrust** required for the rocket
      reasonImage: /img/reason-3.svg
    - body: Only a small rocket is required resulting in smaller operating **costs**
      reasonImage: /img/reason-4.svg
    - body: '**Safer** ground operations'
      reasonImage: /img/reason-5.svg
    - body: Huge ground **infrastructure** not required

        TU2Space is a student led project within the School of Science
        Engineering and Design at Teesside. The project was initiated by the
        school with the basic concept of developing a small space launch system
        for a femto-satellites. Andrew and Ben are student project managers of
        the TU2Space project and have recently co-founded a start-up business,
        StratoBooster. 
    - ourStoryText: >-
        StratoBooster is focused in the development of a High-altitude Balloon
        Launched Rocket system, capable in helping organisations and
        institutions launch their small satellites and payloads into space

        Their business plans are to commercialise their work from TU2Space with
        the aim of further researching and testing their current work and
        developing the small space launch system for customers, who have already
        expressed interest in using this system.

        With the reduced operating costs compared with other providers of space
        launches, flexible launch locations and the effects of weather on
        balloons were small, resulting in a strong ground launch system, we aim
        to:

    Andrew Dunn and Ben Massey are Aerospace Engineering students at Teesside
    University. During their 2nd year they became involved in a project now
    called TU2Space.

      Andrew Dunn and Ben Massey, both second-year BEng (Hons) Aerospace
      Engineering students at Teesside University, set up StratoBooster, a
      spin-off of the student-led space exploration project TU2Space.

      StratoBooster is a space launch system, to launch small satellites into
      low earth orbit by means of a high-altitude balloon and small rocket
      launch, from the stratosphere, all done from the UK.
