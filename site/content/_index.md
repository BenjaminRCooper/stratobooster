    Andrew Dunn and Ben Massey are Aerospace Engineering students at Teesside
    University. During their 2nd year they became involved in a project now
    called TU2Space. It is here that they met Shaun Whitehead, a Space Engineer!

    TU2Space is a student led project within the School of Science Engineering
    and Design at Teesside. The project was initiated by Shaun after he
    approached the University with the basic concept of developing a small space
    launch system for a femto-satellite called Thumbsat.

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
